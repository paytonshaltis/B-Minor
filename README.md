# CSC-425 Compilers Project: Parser

## UPDATE: Parser Progress #2
Modified some of the existing production rules since last time as well as adding a few more to account for mistakes that I spotted while writting my own test code. `good0.bminor` through `good4.bminor` as well as `bad0.bminor` through `bad4.bminor` are all up and working as intended, and test for the first half of what I feel are the most important production rules to test. The last remaining items for this step of the compiler include finishing up the test cases, as well as a thorough look at all production rules again to make sure that the parser will serve as good foundation for the parts to come next.

## Parser Progress Check #1
All of the production rules that I could think of up until this point have been implemented. This includes balanced if/else and for statements. As of now, all 30 instructor test cases are working with my current implementation. The `main.c` file was updated to accept the `-parse` command line option, and my program still works fine with the `-scan` option. The most interesting file to look at would be `parser.bison`, which holds all of the production rules organized for readability and commented to enhance understanding of their purposes. I still need to write my own test cases, which means testing corner cases that may cause my production rules to change between now and the final submission.
