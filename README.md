# CSC-425 Compilers Project: Typechecker

## UPDATE: Typechecker Progress Check 1
Name resolution seems to be working pretty much completely. Each of the AST component files (`decl.c`, `expr.c`, etc.) have been modified with an appropriate `resolve()` function that checks each identifier in a certain scope to ensure that no redefinitions occur. Two new files - `scope.h` and `scope.c` serve as the interface to the program's scope, calling functions from `hash_table.c` in order to push and pop hash tables to and from a stack that represents the different scopes in the program. Currently, all instructor test cases work in terms of name resolution; they do not all exit with proper return codes because typechecking is not complete yet. Using the `-resolve` command-line option will currently print to the standard output the locality of an identifier (global, local, parameter, or if the identifier represents the name of a function prototype or implementation, updating as they are declared again), the name of the identifier, and whether it was added to, referenced from, or updated in the symbol table. Typechecking will conclude within the next week for final submission of this phase of the project.
