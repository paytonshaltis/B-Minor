# CSC-425 Compilers Project: Pretty Printer

## Pretty Printer Progress Check #1
All semantic actions have been added to `parser.bison`, and some grammar production rules were modified to correct for small issues I noticed with the parsing process. Some rules were redundant and were removed for simplicity. The AST node files, which include `decl.c`, `stmt.c`, `param_list.c`, `expr.c`, and `type.c` have all been created, and each implements several 'create' and 'print' functions for their respective AST nodes. All 20 instructor test cases pass, and all but 1 test case outputs the correctly printed source which parses correctly again when used as the source. `good6.bminor` is the test case in question, and the only remedy needed to make it print correctly is to eliminate unneccesary parentheses. 1 test case is currently under investigation; we are currently trying to determine if it is legal syntax to define arrays of indeterminate size outside of function parameter lists.
