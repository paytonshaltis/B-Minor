# CSC-425 Compilers Project: Pretty Printer

## Final: Pretty Printer Project Submission
The Pretty Printer part of the compiler constructs an abstract syntax tree and prints it back out to the user. It was created by writing semantic routines in the `parser.bison` file, as well as adding the files needed to represent nodes in the AST, including `decl.c`, `stmt.c`, `param_list.c`, `expr.c`, and `type.c`. By using the `-print` command line option, the compiler will scan, parse, and print the code that was input. Any errors in scanning or parsing will give a line number that tells where an error went wrong. Scan errors are reported on the correct line, while parse errors are not always exact due to how the code is parser. All instructor test cases except for `good1.bminor` work due to the non-fixed array sizes in that file. All student test cases have been written and work as intended. Minimal parenthesis also have been implemented so that the printed version of the code uses the minimal amount of them.

## Pretty Printer Progress Check #1
All semantic actions have been added to `parser.bison`, and some grammar production rules were modified to correct for small issues I noticed with the parsing process. Some rules were redundant and were removed for simplicity. The AST node files, which include `decl.c`, `stmt.c`, `param_list.c`, `expr.c`, and `type.c` have all been created, and each implements several 'create' and 'print' functions for their respective AST nodes. All 20 instructor test cases pass, and all but 1 test case outputs the correctly printed source which parses correctly again when used as the source. `good6.bminor` is the test case in question, and the only remedy needed to make it print correctly is to eliminate unneccesary parentheses. 1 test case is currently under investigation; we are currently trying to determine if it is legal syntax to define arrays of indeterminate size outside of function parameter lists.
