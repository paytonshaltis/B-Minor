# CSC-425 Compilers Project: Typechecker

## Typechecker Progress Check 1
Name resolution seems to be working pretty much completely. Each of the AST component files (`decl.c`, `expr.c`, etc.) have been modified with an appropriate `resolve()` function that checks each identifier in a certain scope to ensure that no redefinitions occur. Two new files - `scope.h` and `scope.c` serve as the interface to the program's scope, calling functions from `hash_table.c` in order to push and pop hash tables to and from a stack that represents the different scopes in the program. Currently, all instructor test cases work in terms of name resolution; they do not all exit with proper return codes because typechecking is not complete yet. Using the `-resolve` command-line option will currently print to the standard output anytime an identifier is added to, referenced, or in the case of function prototypes, modified in the symbol table. More desireable output will be added within the next week, as well as concluding this phase in the project with typechecking.
