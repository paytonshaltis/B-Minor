// testing the "\0" escape sequence in strings and in chars

// strings can have the NULL escape sequence anywhere
"This string should stop right now.\0";
"This string should sto- \0 -p prematurely...";

// these chars both print a space
' ';               
'\ ';

// this char prints nothing; it is just the NULL terminator character
'\0';

// this is the proper way to represent the char literal 'e'
'e';

/* unlike strings, chars do NOT have NULL terminators; they 
are single characters, so this should result in an error */
'e\0';
