// testing escape characters and special symbols in comments

// for a single comment, do \t\h\e\s\e \w\o\r\k\? \n \0
/* how about for a comment \l\i\k\e \t\h\i\s? \n \0 */

/* since a comment just ignores everything after its start symbol,
   even characters not allowed in bminor will work with comments:
   ~ ` @ # $ & | \ .                                               */
